            <h2>Hello, I'm Daniel!</h2>
                <p>In 2020, due to closures and restrictions caused by the Covid-19 global pandemic, 
                    I was sadly let go from my job as a poker dealer in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. However, 
                    instead of waiting and hoping that my previous job would eventually come calling, 
                    I decided to use my free time to learn new skills online. I had always enjoyed 
                    working with computers so I began learning about business staples like Excel and PowerPoint. 
                    Eventually, my odyssey took me into the realm of web design and coding which culminated in 
                    a capstone project to design my own webpage; the very page you are visiting right now! 
                </p>
                <h3>*** To Those Grading This Project ***</h3>
                <p>You should notice that this webpage responds to a variety of screen sizes and orientations. 
                    On mobile devices all information is displayed in a single column with a sticky dropdown navigation bar 
                    at the top and different colored sections. However, turning the device sideways into "landscape" view, will 
                    change the navigation bar from a dropdown menu to an inline list. Viewing the page on a desktop or laptop will display the
                    navigation down the left side of the screen with added icons. The title is replaced with an animated gif of my creation and
                    items on the main section of the page will now appear in more columns, as can be seen in the Experience lists, the Skills links, and the
                    High/Low game. I also replaced the solid lines under the section headers with a page break image.
                </p>
                <p>Regardless of your viewing device, a carousel of pictures appears at the top of the main page. Use the 
                    left and right arrows to see the different pictures. All links have some sort of hover effect and Javascript was also added to 
                    give a smooth scroll when clicking on one of the navigation links. Also using Javascript, hovering over the pictures at the top of the 
                    Experience, Education, and For Fun sections will display a new picture. Clicking on any of the 
                    links in the Skills section will display the corresponding certificate in a "Light Box". In the For Fun section, 
                    you will see a game I created using Javascript with numerous steps taken to validate the input. Give it a try and 
                    good luck! Lastly, I created a form where you can contact me if you have any questions.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Please take the time to run the page through W3C validation as well as Webaim. I made sure to carefully craft this page with
                    semantics and accessability in mind. It took 216 lines of HTML, 943 lines of CSS styling, and 169 lines of Javascript code to 
                    make this page so please take your time and explore. Thank you very much for your time and effort!

                </ul>
                <p>Though I initially applied to be a poker dealer, in May 2006 I was hired as a part-time cashier in the poker room. After about a month, I became 
                        the full-time swing shift cashier and I held that position until March of 2007 when I was promoted 
                        to poker dealer. I spent the next 13 years perfecting my craft and getting to know many of our regular 
                        customers. Starting in 2020, I began officially training to become a supervisor and tournament director. My training 
                        was completed in March, one week before the Red Rock closed.

                <p>After my 2nd year at UCLA, I decided to take a year off from my studies and move back home. I was hired as a courtesy clerk at the local Vons Supermarket. 
                    I was eventually promoted to Meat Department Assistant where I worked for a few months before returning to UCLA.

                    My job consisted mostly of answering phones, dispatching workers, and inputing data into the company computer.

                    <p>I came from a long line of UCLA Bruins so when it came time to apply to colleges, I only applied to one. To my great delight, 
                        I was accepted into my dream school to play baseball. Unfortunately, I injured my shoulder during my senior year of high school 
                        and despite a full summer of very strenuous rehab, I reinjured it during my first year at UCLA. Without baseball, I began to feel lost and 
                        decided to take a one year break after my second year. In 2003, I returned to UCLA and joined the Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America. I focused my studies on 
                        history and spent much of my time playing poker and participating in fraternity activities. I left UCLA in 2006 and immediately moved to Las Vegas with 
                        the hope of becoming a poker dealer.

                    <p>I left middle school as a scrawny, bullied kid, but arrived at high school nearly a foot taller and ready for a new beginning. I played both football and 
                        baseball my freshman year but after that, I decided to stick with only baseball. By my senior year, I was getting straight As and I was not only playing on the school varsity team but 
                        also on the Pasadena Red Birds, a travelling scout team affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals.
