            <h2>Hello, I'm Daniel!</h2>
                <p>In 2020, due to closures and restrictions caused by the Covid-19 global pandemic, 
                    I was sadly let go from my job as a poker dealer in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. However, 
                    instead of waiting and hoping that my previous job would eventually come calling, 
                    I decided to use my free time to learn new skills online. I had always enjoyed 
                    working with computers so I began learning about business staples like Excel and PowerPoint. 
                    Eventually, my odyssey took me into the realm of web design and coding which culminated in 
                    a capstone project to design my own webpage; the very page you are visiting right now!

                    <li>Cashier</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Though I initially applied to be a poker dealer, in May 2006 I was hired as a part-time cashier in the poker room. After about a month, I became 
                        the full-time swing shift cashier and I held that position until March of 2007 when I was promoted 
                        to poker dealer. I spent the next 13 years perfecting my craft and getting to know many of our regular 
                        customers. Beginning in 2020, I began officially training to become a supervisor and tournament director. My training 
                        was completed in March, one week before the Red Rock closed.

                <p>After my 2nd year at UCLA, I decided to take a year off from my studies and move back home. I was hired as a courtesy clerk at the local Vons Supermarket. 
                    I eventually was promoted to Meat Department Assistant where I worked for a few months before returning to UCLA.

                <p>During the summers of 1999 through 2001, I worked as an office assistant at GNA Brook Fire Protection. 
                    My job mostly consisted of answering phones, dispatching workers, and inputing data into the company computer.

                    <p>I came from a long line of UCLA Bruins so when it came time to apply to colleges, I only applied to one. To my great delight, 
                        I was accepted into my dream school to play baseball. Unfortunately, I injured my shoulder during my senior year of high school 
                        and despite a full summer of very strenuous rehab, I reinjured it during my first year at UCLA. Without baseball, I began to feel lost and 
                        decided to take a one year break after my second year. In 2003, I returned to UCLA and joined the Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America. I focused my studies on 
                        history and spent much of my time playing poker and participating in fraternity activities. I left UCLA in 2006 and immediately moved to Las Vegas with 
                        the hope of becoming a poker dealer.

                    <p>I left middle school as a scrawny, bullied kid, but arrived at high school nearly a foot taller and ready for a new beginning. I played both football and 
                        baseball my freshman year but after that, I decided to stick with only baseball. By my senior year, I was getting straight As and I was not only playing on the school varsity team but 
                        also on the Pasadena Red Birds, a travelling scout team affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals.

                    <p>To showcase what I have learned in my web design courses, I thought it would be fun to use all this knowledge to create a little game. The object of the game is 
                        to try to guess the correct number. After each guess you will be told if the correct number is higher or lower. Good luck!
